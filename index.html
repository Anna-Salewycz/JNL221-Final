      <p>Next Saturday marks six months since the overturning of <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, the 1973 Supreme Court case that guaranteed the constitutional right to abortion. On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court reversed nearly 50 years of legal precedent. The Center for Reproductive Rights filed <em>Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization</em> in March 2018 to challenge Mississippi’s ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Mississippi took the case to the Supreme Court, initially arguing that its ban was constitutional under <em>Roe v. Wade</em>. After former President Donald Trump nominated justice Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court in 2020, however, a conservative 6-3 majority developed, prompting Mississippi to ask the Court to overturn <em>Roe v. Wade</em>.</p>
      <p>Each state is now at liberty to decide its own abortion policies and reproductive rights. 13 states have implemented total abortion bans since June’s ruling, forcing all clinics within those states to stop offering abortions. Although abortion is still legal in most of the US, many states are hostile toward it and have restrictions in place. Utah, for example, is enforcing a ban on abortion after 18 weeks of pregnancy, more specifically weeks since the last menstrual period, and has attempted to enforce its trigger ban to prohibit abortion entirely. The Guttmacher Institute’s state legislative tracking predicts that 13 more states are likely to ban abortion within the next six months.</p>

      <p>The 13 states where abortion is illegal accounted for 112,460 abortions in 2020, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Every three years, the Guttmacher Institute contacts all known US abortion facilities to collect information for its Abortion Provider Census. The Institute completed its most recent census with data from 2019-2020 in May 2022. California and New York, two historically liberal states with major cities, had the most abortions in 2020, while Florida and Texas, two traditionally red, anti-abortion states, came in third and fourth. Although Georgia has the seventh highest number of abortions in 2020, it’s six-week abortion ban leaves residents with the same options as people in states with total bans. Most women discover they are pregnant around six-weeks, leaving very little time for scheduling and obtaining care. The closing of these clinics also impacts states where abortion remains legal. The Guttmacher Institute collected anecdotal evidence and found that women are fleeing from states with abortion bans to other states to seek care, creating a massive influx of patients. States where abortion remains legal but limited saw an 11% increase in the number of abortions, according to data from Axios. Clinics in these states are operating far beyond their capacity and their staff is overworked, subsequently increasing wait times for appointments. </p>
      <p>The number of abortions in the US increased by 8% from 2017 to 2020, according to the Guttmacher Institute. The Institute’s research indicates the need for abortion was steadily increasing at the time <em>Roe v. Wade</em> was overturned. This further exacerbated the ruling’s impact, especially for people who already struggled to access abortion care prior to the overturning. The 1976 Hyde Amendment, for example, prohibits federal funding for abortion, preventing people enrolled in Medicaid, Medicare, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, also known as CHIP, from using their health insurance to cover abortion care. In 2019, 29% of Black and 25% of Hispanic women ages 15-49 were enrolled in Medicaid, while 15% were white, according to the Guttmacher Institute. The Hyde Amendment disproportionately affects low-income women, especially those of color.</p>
      <p>“More people, especially Black women, die right now in the United States giving birth than people who die at war,” said Alexandra Hearn, a former Planned Parenthood peer health advocate.</p>
      <p>The US has the highest maternal mortality rate among developed nations, and US Black and Indigenous women are around three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than white women, according to data from the Center for Reproductive Rights. Hearn believes the government should focus on improving hospitals to ensure mothers' safety. Abortion is a medical decision that should be up to the individual, Hearn said.</p>
      <p>Although <em>Roe v. Wade</em> offered a sense of security, it was a foundation that policymakers needed to build on to fully guarantee the right to abortion. But the foundation has crumbled, and it’s hitting marginalized Americans that face healthcare disparities much harder than other communities. This includes people with low incomes, people of color, people with disabilities, young people, people living in rural communities, undocumented immigrants, and members of the LGBTQ+ community. 75% of abortion patients are low income, 53% are Black and Hispanic, and 60% are young adults in their 20’s, according to the Guttmacher Institute.</p>

      <p>Although the overturning of <em>Roe v. Wade</em> disproportionately affects people who struggle with systemic oppression, it also impacts multitudes of people across America.  Abortion has become a widely shared experience for Americans of all different ages, races, ethnicities, and religions. One in four US women ends a pregnancy in her lifetime, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights. The Guttmacher Institute’s most recent Abortion Provider Census found that abortion incidence increased in all four US regions between 2017-2020. Despite the growing need for abortion care in the US, data from the Institute shows that more than half of all US women of reproductive age live in states currently hostile to abortion rights. The overturning of <em>Roe v. Wade</em> also affects OB-GYN residency programs, according to the New York Times. Many residency programs for obstetricians and gynecologists in states with total abortion bans must choose whether to continue providing abortion training. If they carry on, they risk being prosecuted, but if they stop offering it, they risk losing their accreditation.</p>
      <p>64% of American voters believe in the individual’s right to choose whether to have an abortion, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights. November’s US midterm election results are a testament to this. People in Kentucky, Michigan, Montana, Vermont, and California voted in favor of protecting abortion rights. The overturning of <em>Roe v. Wade</em> and other anti-abortion efforts will never eradicate the need for abortions; they will only force people to go through extraneous efforts to get the care they need.</p>
